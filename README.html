<h1>RQ</h1>

<p>RQ is a <strong>simple</strong> queueing/messaging system for <em>any</em> Unix system and can process
messages in <strong>any language</strong>.
It is designed to run on every machine in your distributed system.
Think of it as another one of those small, but
important services (like crond). It uses directories and json text files on the Unix filesystem
as its database. It does not use a specialized database. As a result, it is easy to
understand and debug.</p>

<p>Each item in the queue is a <strong>Message</strong>. Messages can be small, but RQ was designed for a medium to large granularity.
For example, messages could have attachments with 100s to 1000s of megabytes.
Each message can be processed by the local machine or relayed reliably to another
machine for processing. These machines don&rsquo;t have to be in the same data center and in fact can be on another continent. When a message is received in a queue, a worker process is started to process the message. The worker process is one-to-one with a unix process. (some call
this a &lsquo;forking&rsquo; model). The code required to implement a worker is very small. Also, API is compatible with any language that runs on Unix. While a worker is processing a message, you can
view a real-time display of logs (with ANSI colors) via the browser.</p>

<p>It has been used in production since 2009 and processed billions of messages at brightroll.
It has a full test suite that verifies the system.</p>

<p>In the future, there is a goal of building a version that uses a single consistent store (something like MongoDB).</p>

<p>Here is a sample screenshot of a single queue:</p>

<p><img src="docs/rq_screen_shot.png" title="Example Screen Shot" alt="Screen Shot" /></p>

<a name="A.brief.overview.of.the.system."></a>
<h2>A brief overview of the system.</h2>

<p>Once RQ is installed, the user creates a queue. The queue requires only a few
parameters, but the most important one is the &lsquo;queue script&rsquo;. This is a program
written in <em>any</em> language that will process each message. The API for the queue
script is easy to
implement and described below. Whenever a message is received on that queue,
this program runs. The program will either succeed, fail, or ask to retry <em>x</em> seconds in
the future. If the script takes a long time to run, it can send periodic updates
to RQ to indicate progress. The script can also provide a lot of logging
and produces large files as output.</p>

<p>The RQ system provides a REST, HTML, cmd-line, or low-level socket
API to work with messages and queues. That is all there is to it.</p>

<p>When would you use RQ?
In a typical web application, you should always respond to the browser within a small
time frame (say under 1 seconds). You should also avoid using a lot of memory in this section
of your application stack as well. If you know a particular computation will exceed
those requirements, you should hand off the task to a queueing system.</p>

<p>If you have scripts that run via cron, you should probably run that under RQ. In this scenario, RQ will monitor that the script properly executed.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transcoding a video file (high cpu)</li>
<li>Implement a large query for a user in the background</li>
<li>Have a queue for curl requests for URLs passed in</li>
<li>A processing pipeline of files stored in S3 (light map/reduce)

<ul>
<li>retrieve</li>
<li>filter</li>
<li>reduce</li>
<li>sftp to partner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy an update to systems all over the world for user-facing web app (high latency)</li>
<li>Periodically rotate and send HTTP logs to a NOSQL database for search and analysis</li>
<li>Verify URLs with Internet Explorer (and take screenshots) on a box controllable via a simple web api</li>
<li>Spin up EC2 instances via AWS api</li>
</ul>


<a name="Small.Dose.of.Philosophy"></a>
<h2>Small Dose of Philosophy</h2>

<p>The people behind RQ have been working on Unix since the late 1980&rsquo;s. The focus
of RQ has been on reliability and the ease of understanding. The author prefers
systems that allow him to sleep soundly at night, and he thinks the design of
RQ allows him to achieve this. There is a lot to talk about here and why the existing
systems didn&rsquo;t solve the problem. If you are interested in that, read the full
philosphy section below.</p>

<p>Also, if you were on the internet in the 80s or 90s, you will see that this system bears some resemblance to the UUCP system deployed back then. It was definitely an inspiration for the design of this system.</p>

<p><a name='section_Quick_Setup'></a></p>

<a name="Quick.Setup"></a>
<h2>Quick Setup</h2>

<p>You will need:</p>

<ol>
<li>Source to RQ</li>
<li>A unique FQDN for the system if production.</li>
</ol>


<p>Clone the github repo.
Untar the system in a directory of your choosing.</p>

<p>Run <code>./bin/web_server.rb --install</code></p>

<p>Now go to the web UI to follow the steps to complete an installation.</p>

<p>This should setup the RQ directory system and a few default queues.</p>

<p>Run the <code>/etc/init.d/rq stop</code> script</p>

<p>There should be no processes with rq running.</p>

<p>Run the <code>/etc/init.d/rq start</code> script</p>

<p>This should start several processes. There should be 1 rq-mgr process and one rq process per queue.
There should also be one <code>web_server.rb</code> process running.</p>

<p>(Also, I did</p>

<ol>
<li>clone the git repository</li>
<li>kill queue manager if it is running (pname: <code>[rq-mgr]</code>)</li>
<li>delete the config directory if it exists</li>
<li>bundle by typing <code>$ gem bundle</code> (bundler ~&lt; 1.x.x) or <code>bundle install</code></li>
<li>run the installer with <code>$ bin/webserver.rb install</code></li>
<li>use a browser to hit the running server, set the domain of the machine</li>
<li>restart the <code>web_server.rb</code> process (after killing, just <code>bin/web_server.rb</code>)</li>
</ol>

<a name="Hip.Tips"></a>
<h2>Hip Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Scripts should be idempotent if at all possible. You should assume that</li>
<li>Messages should not go to error frequently

<ul>
<li>RQ can retry a message if the error is transient. let you kno. If this is happening, something is wrong with your assumptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do not fire and forget an RQ message.

<ul>
<li>It is ok to be more lax in side of the queue script that processes that message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Log output that might help someone other than you diagnose the issue</li>
<li>Crypto - sign and encrypt your message before giving it to RQ. Secure channels is too hard of a problem.</li>
<li>Use the status system for progress updates</li>
<li>Do not run RQ in production with the name &lsquo;localhost&rsquo;</li>
<li>Master passing.Do not access other message directories unless the message is <code>done</code></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t take too long via the Web UI, there is a X second timeout</li>
</ul>


<p><a name='section_Queue_Config_Vars'></a></p>

<a name="Queue.Config.Vars"></a>
<h2>Queue Config Vars</h2>

<p>RQ Queue Config JSON</p>

<p>A typical config:</p>

<p><code>json
{"fsync":"no-fsync","ordering":"none","script":".\/code\/relay_script.rb","num_workers":"1","exec_prefix":"","name":"relay"}
</code></p>

<p><strong> Mandatory Fields </strong></p>

<p>name:
Name of the queue.</p>

<p>script:
The path to the script that will process messages in that queue</p>

<p>num_workers:
The number of processes that can run to handle incoming messages. This
is equivalent to the max number of messages that can be in the run state.
Default: 1</p>

<p>Optional Fields
exec_prefix:
This is what is prefixed to the script before the &lsquo;exec&rsquo; system call is made to run the &ldquo;script&rdquo;. As a default, it is set to &lsquo;bash -lc &rsquo; if not set. Note the space on the end.</p>

<p>env_vars
This is a map of key value pairs that will be established in the environment per script run.</p>

<p><a name='section_Guarantees'></a></p>

<a name="Guarantees"></a>
<h2>Guarantees</h2>

<ul>
<li>Messages cannot be guaranteed to be delivered in order</li>
<li>Messages are unique per machine and should use the unique host name</li>
<li>Messages can be guaranteed to be delivered intact when relayed (MD5)</li>
<li>RQ will not respond with an OK if a message cannot be commited to disk</li>
<li>Queue Scripts that are referenced via symlinks are resolved to their full path before execution

<ul>
<li>(This is especially helpful when you have scripts running and you deploy a new version)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Files are consistent</li>
</ul>


<p>It <em>tries</em> hard to</p>

<ul>
<li><p>insure message is in identical state every run</p></li>
<li><p>avoid duplicate messages
aka - there is a small chance that messages might be duplicated.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It <em>does not try</em> hard to guarantee ordering
  - messages might come in out-of-order. this may happen as a result
    of a failure in the system or operations repointing traffic
    to another rq</p>

<p>given the above, use timestamp versioning to insure an older message
doesn&rsquo;t over-write a newer message. if you see the same timestamp again
for a previously successful txn, it might be that ultra-ultra rare duplicate,
so drop it.</p>

<ul>
<li>You must exit properly with the proper handshake.</li>
</ul>


<p><a name='section_Your_First_Queue_Script'></a></p>

<a name="Your.First.Queue.Script"></a>
<h2>Your First Queue Script</h2>

<p>When developing an RQ script, you should have a problem in mind that requires just a few parameters.</p>

<p>Next you develop a script. You can skip down just a bit to see some examples.</p>

<p>Typically, you will setup RQ on your development enviornment. Then you will setup a <code>queue</code> for your particular
script. Then via the web UI, you will create a new message and submit it. In another tab, you can hit refresh
to the state of the message. If it succeeds, you are done. If not, just edit the code, hit refresh on the tab
that created the message (to resubmit the form and create a new test message), and check on the queue to see if it worked.</p>

<p>Essentially, this turns into a</p>

<p>A question that comes up occassionaly is, how do I test an RQ script?</p>

<p>Right now, the best answer is to create a test environment with the RQ server and queue set up.</p>

<p>Then inject messages into the queue and verify that the messages are consumed and processed correctly.</p>

<p><a name='section_Internals'></a></p>

<a name="Internals"></a>
<h2>Internals</h2>

<p>Currently RQ is written in Ruby.
Ruby definitely has its problems, but overall was an excellent choice.
For more on that decision, see the <a href="#secion_History">History</a> below.</p>

<p>RQ depends heavily on the Unix API.</p>

<p>We use Unix Domain Sockets for the primary RPC mechanism. They work just like TCP sockets, except
we don&rsquo;t have to worry about network security. You rendezvous with the listening process via a
special file on the filessystem. They are better than pipes since they provide 2 way communication.</p>

<p>There are 3 primary systems that make up RQ. The rq-mgr process, the individual rq queue processes, and the
web server process.</p>

<p>The primary process is the rq-mgr process. It sets up a Unix Domain socket and communicates via that for
its primary API. Its
primary function is to watch over and restart the individual rq <em>queue</em> processes. It maintains a standard
Unix pipe to the child rq process to detect child death.</p>

<p>Each queue gets its own process. They also communicate . These monitor their queue directories and worker processes. They have
the state of the &lsquo;que&rsquo; queue in memory. It also uses a standard unix pipe to communicate with the rq-mgr.
For queue scripts it maintains.</p>

<p>The web server exists to give RQ a human (HTML) and non-human (REST) interface using the HTTP standard. This makes
it easy to use via a browser, cURL, or with just about any HTTP lib that comes with any language.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<p>When working in distributed systems, you will eventually learn that some part of the system will be down or unavailable
for many unknown reasons. For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>DNS update breaks dns in infrastructure</li>
<li>Change or failure in network switch makes</li>
</ul>


<p>Also, when working in a large system, you end up having many parts that are important, but not the critical path.
There are also many layers, and developers cannot anticipate all of the different errors that can occur.
Given the lack of priority, sometimes you just need a system that is easy to diagnose and fix.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most systems are designed so that the framework to deal with the above is left to the engineers.
For example, everybody agrees that errors are bad and will occur. Yet there are many systems that will silently
 ignore errors.</p>

<p>There is also a general lack of understanding of Unix best practices. For example, when DHH proclaimed to
&lsquo;cheat&rsquo; by running ImageMagick in a separate process, this was a huge revelation to the community.
Overall, people</p>

<p>RQ is designed to mitigate a large portion of this.</p>

<p>It is process based. This eliminates the single message taking down the whole system problem</p>

<p><a name='section_History'></a></p>

<a name="History"></a>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>During my career, it was common to see people rediscover the need for queueing systems over and over again.
Typically, there is a spectrum for queueing systems. On one end there is the high-speed, message bus
type system that runs a stock exchange. On the other end of the spectrum, you could consider email.</p>

<p>Typically, properly implemented queueing systems required serious infrastructure.
In fact, because of performance issues, most of these do not persist to disk.
The high-end ones have complex APIs and usually are designed for small message sizes.</p>

<p>Then there are the home grown systems which are usually implemented on Redis or memcache</p>

<p>Then there are the basic ones that run off of a SQL database.</p>

<p>All of these require external systems to handle the state.</p>

<p>I decided to make several bets:</p>

<ol>
<li>There might be a quadrant for a general purpose, lightweight queue manager that existed per machine</li>
<li>The system should be able to move huge files</li>
<li>Ruby was a <em>good enough</em> systems language</li>
<li>The Ruby VM would be much better within a few years</li>
<li>The Unix filesystem would be fast enough</li>
</ol>


<p>However, only a few of these panned out.</p>

<p>At the time, it was the goto language of choice at BrightRoll.
Other languages were considered that were significantly different than Ruby, but didn&rsquo;t seem
appropriate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Java - memory footprint is way too high. POSIX support is poor (process control, signals, etc.).</li>
<li>Python - practically equivalent to Ruby, and most were rubyists</li>
<li>NodeJS - was not nearly baked, very promissing. They are the only system to get Unix since C.</li>
<li>Go / Golang - may not have existed. If it did, it surely was not baked.</li>
<li>Erlang - interesting language under consideration. I really liked the concurrency model, but the
         environment was way too out of our experience zone.</li>
<li>Lisp, ML, Haskell,  etc. - A lot like Erlang, except without a good concurrency model.</li>
<li>C - would take way too much time</li>
<li>C++ - even more time than C</li>
</ul>


<p>My goals were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get something running</li>
<li>Should be easy to install (think PHP apps&hellip; through the browser)</li>
<li>Should be easy to update (think Wordpress)</li>
<li>No dependencies with Ruby (it should just work)</li>
</ul>


<p>Of all of those, only the first occurred.</p>

<p>Again, Ruby was a good choice.
It was pretty easy to get certain features implemented and into production. The three biggest
drawbacks to ruby were</p>

<ol>
<li>Poor IO support for async IO</li>
<li>GEMS. GEM conflicts are a huge problem.</li>
<li><p>Overall speed of the language</p></li>
<li><p>When it was initially developed on Mac OS X, it was immediately discovered that the directories would have
to be named (.noindex) as the activity of RQ caused a tremendous load on Spotlight.
Now I do my development of RQ via ssh to a VirtualBOX Ubuntu instance.</p></li>
<li>We ran into the GLIBC issue where DNS would no longer round-robin.</li>
</ol>


<p>Yet, even with these drawbacks, the overall architecture proved to work pretty well. The forking model hides
most of the issues that someone would run into with.</p>

<p>Queue Script Processing</p>

<p>Each queue script runs as a child of an rq process for that queue.
The queue script process communicates with that process via a simple pipe.
The stdio fds (stdout and stderr) are redirected to a file.</p>

<p>By sending the following:</p>

<p>CMD SPACE TEXT NL</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>CMD = run | done | err | relayed | resend | dup</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, the TEXT cannot have any newline characters.
The &lsquo;TEXT&rsquo; should be small in size.  There is no limit, but realistically, anything over 200 characters is probably unneccessary.</p>

<p>CMD Codes</p>

<p>run - When the script is running, it is in &lsquo;run&rsquo;. To send an updated status to the operator about the operation of the script, just send a &lsquo;run&rsquo; with TEXT as the status.
example: run Processed 5 of 15 log files.<nl></p>

<p>done - When the script is finished, and has successfully performed its processing. It sends this response. It <em>must</em> also exit with a 0 status or it will go to &lsquo;err&rsquo;.
example: done done<nl></p>

<p>err - When the script has failed, and we want to message to go to &lsquo;err&rsquo; (probably to notify someone that something has gone wrong and needs operator attention). Any exit status at this point will take the message to &lsquo;err&rsquo;.
example: err Mysql dump script failed.<nl></p>

<p>resend - When the script has failed, but we want to just retry running it again, we respond with a &lsquo;resend&rsquo;. This will cause a message to go back into &lsquo;que&rsquo; with a due time of X seconds into the future.
resend TEXT = DUE DASH REASON
DUE = num seconds to wait from now
REASON = free text
example: resend 300-Memcached reflow-west.btrlll.com not responding.<nl></p>

<p>relayed - This is used by the relay queue and should not be used by a user queue script.</p>

<p>dup - Create a clone of the existing message (including attachments) to the new destination.
NOTE: This is the first status response that is a 2 way conversation with the queue process.
If the queue does match /^https?:/, then it goes to &lsquo;relay&rsquo; to be sent on. Otherwise it is considered
a local. If relay or the local queue doesn&rsquo;t exist or is admin DOWN/PAUSE, then the the response
will indicate failure. This resets the current count for the newly generated message.</p>

<p>dup TEXT = DUE DASH FUTUREFLAG DASH NEWDEST
DUE = num seconds to wait from now (USE 0 for NOW) to run
FUTUREFLAG = &lsquo;X&rsquo; for now now
NEWDEST = proper RQ destination queue
example: dup 0-X-http://blocking08.vbtrll.com/q/barrier_wait<nl></p>

<p>response:
STATUS SPACE CONTENT
STATUS = ok | fail
CONTENT = for ok: <new message id> | for fail: <some failure message></p>

<p>RQ</p>

<p>RQ is a simple queuing system based on message passing.</p>

<p>Every</p>

<p>Architecture</p>

<p>The system exists in one directory. The commands to operate on a queue are bound to the queues in the directory the commands exist in.</p>

<p>The system is composed of a web server and a supervisor process. The webserver is Sinatra running on Rack running on Webrick. This may change.
All processes are single threaded.
The web server communicates with the supervisor process on a unix domain socket.</p>

<p>There will only be one supervisor process.
The supervisor process starts up queue supervisor (quesup) processes for all the queues.
Any children of any process will have a pipe to their parent. If that pipe goes away, a child should shut down immediately.</p>

<p>There should only be one quesup for a given queue. A file-lock will be used for safety.
Since there is only one, no locks are required in the filesystem to manage the queue for injection.</p>

<p>It handles all communication and</p>

<ul>
<li>Note - it is possible to have duplicate sends.
If a message gets commited, but we feel it is a fail,
we may eventually try to resend. If we hit a new machine,
then we will restart the process and resend. If the old
machine comes back up, it will retart its message handling.</li>
